# JumpGame
A simple terminal game
I've created this game to refresh my knowledge after a break from programming.
It's a copy of a game I've created a long time ago by using C++, which was surprisingly easier to do than with Python.
It's my first try to create a program that should look professional, so if you'd notice something that could be done easier/betterm let me know/
